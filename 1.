This comprehensive file demonstrates all three aspects of Django signal behavior:

1. Synchronous Execution:
   - The creation of the second object is delayed until after the signal handler for the first object completes.
   - The total execution time is approximately 4 seconds (2 seconds per signal handler).

2. Thread Behavior:
   - The signal handlers run in the same threads as their respective callers.
   - You'll see that the thread names in the signal handler match those of the object creation.

3. Transaction Behavior:
   - The signal handler runs in the same transaction as the caller.
   - When an exception is raised in the signal handler, both the TestModel and RelatedModel objects are not saved to the database due to transaction rollback.

To run this code, you would need to set up a Django project and add this to a Django app's models.py file. You'd also need to ensure the app is included in INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py.

The output will demonstrate:
1. Synchronous execution with delayed object creation and cumulative execution time.
2. Signal handlers running in the same threads as their callers.
3. Signal handlers participating in the same database transaction as their callers.

This comprehensive example conclusively proves that Django signals are synchronous, run in the caller's thread, and participate in the caller's database transaction by default.
