Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller. I'll demonstrate this with a code snippet that conclusively proves this behavior.



```python
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
import threading
import time

class TestModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

@receiver(post_save, sender=TestModel)
def signal_handler(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    current_thread = threading.current_thread()
    print(f"Signal handler started for {instance.name} in thread: {current_thread.name}")
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate some work
    print(f"Signal handler finished for {instance.name} in thread: {current_thread.name}")

def create_object(name):
    current_thread = threading.current_thread()
    print(f"Creating object {name} in thread: {current_thread.name}")
    TestModel.objects.create(name=name)
    print(f"Object {name} created in thread: {current_thread.name}")

def test_signal_thread_behavior():
    # Create objects in the main thread
    create_object("MainThread1")
    create_object("MainThread2")

    # Create objects in separate threads
    thread1 = threading.Thread(target=create_object, args=("Thread1",))
    thread2 = threading.Thread(target=create_object, args=("Thread2",))

    thread1.start()
    thread2.start()

    thread1.join()
    thread2.join()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_signal_thread_behavior()

```

This code demonstrates that Django signals run in the same thread as the caller. Here's how it works:

1. We define a `TestModel` with a simple `name` field.
2. We create a signal handler `signal_handler` that prints the name of the thread it's running in.
3. The `create_object` function creates a `TestModel` object and also prints the name of the thread it's running in.
4. The `test_signal_thread_behavior` function creates objects both in the main thread and in separate threads.

When you run this code, you'll see output similar to this:

```
Creating object MainThread1 in thread: MainThread
Signal handler started for MainThread1 in thread: MainThread
Signal handler finished for MainThread1 in thread: MainThread
Object MainThread1 created in thread: MainThread

Creating object MainThread2 in thread: MainThread
Signal handler started for MainThread2 in thread: MainThread
Signal handler finished for MainThread2 in thread: MainThread
Object MainThread2 created in thread: MainThread

Creating object Thread1 in thread: Thread-1
Signal handler started for Thread1 in thread: Thread-1
Signal handler finished for Thread1 in thread: Thread-1
Object Thread1 created in thread: Thread-1

Creating object Thread2 in thread: Thread-2
Signal handler started for Thread2 in thread: Thread-2
Signal handler finished for Thread2 in thread: Thread-2
Object Thread2 created in thread: Thread-2
```

This output conclusively proves that Django signals run in the same thread as the caller because:

1. For objects created in the main thread, both the object creation and signal handler execution occur in the "MainThread".
2. For objects created in separate threads (Thread-1 and Thread-2), the signal handlers also execute in those same threads.

If the signals were to run in a different thread, we would see mismatched thread names between the object creation and signal handler execution.

This behavior demonstrates that Django signals indeed run in the same thread as the caller, maintaining the execution context of the operation that triggered the signal.
